# EDA-Course-Project-1
My solution to EDA Course Project 1

Hello! And thank you for reviewing my work. Please run code in the following order:
1. EDA CP1 Data Cleaning Code.R
2. EDA CP1 Plot 1.R
3. EDA CP1 Plot 2.R
4. EDA CP1 Plot 3.R
5. EDA CP1 Plot 4.R

At the end of running all of the code, you should be able to open your directory folder and view the png files. 

Have a great day!
